# HOUSE-DATSET-EDA
# House Price Dataset Analysis Project README

This repository contains the code and results of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on the House Price Dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and any significant correlations among its variables.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main folders:

- `Src`: Contains Jupyter Notebook files with the analysis code.
- `Data`: Stores the House Price Dataset (train.csv file).
- `Docs`: Reserved for additional documentation, if any.
- `Results`: Houses generated plots and the final PDF report.

### Project Overview

In this project, we undertake the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The "train.csv" file for the House Price Dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

2. **Data Exploration**: The dataset was loaded into a Jupyter Notebook, and basic exploratory analysis was conducted, including handling missing values and preprocessing.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to better understand the dataset's distribution.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: We assessed the relationships between different variables using correlation coefficients and visualizations.

5. **Summary Report**: The Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive summary of the findings, offering insights, interpretations, and noteworthy observations.

6. **PDF Report**: The Jupyter Notebook was converted to a PDF report for easier sharing and presentation.

### Project Files

- `Src/House_Price_EDA.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and detailed documentation.
- `Data/train.csv`: The House Price Dataset in CSV format.
